[VietLit](https://vietlit.com/) is an online literature platform whose goal is to honor original works by Vietnamese authors and nurture a passionate and supportive community for online Vietnamese literature. Founded in 2020 by a small group of Vietnamese youths living across several time zones, VietLit distinguishes our product by our emphasis on authenticity. We put effort into screening all the works uploaded to our website to ensure they meet our quality requirements and nurturing close professional relationships with authors. With our values being quality, creativity, familiarity, culture and orientation, we are a Viet website created for Viet people and those who are interested in listening to our authentic voices and learning about our culture.

During my time with VietLit, we went through **three** big phases: (1) researching the market and building internal teams, (2) launching and running social media campaigns to build an audience base for our product, and (3) launching and maintaining our product â€“ VietLit website. The team grew from 6 to 40 people divided by functions, our social media presence expanding from Facebook to Instagram and Youtube, our number of organic followers on Facebook (our main promotional channel) growing to 5K+ and our number of website users increasing everyday.

My primary role in VietLit was **Project Manager of Human Resources**. For the internal team(s), I was responsible for devising the organizational structure for VietLit, which involved determining the sub-teams, the roles and the workspaces for each team, compiling job descriptions and requirements, recruiting and onboarding, ensuring smooth cross-functional collaboration, resolving conflicts and maintaining working culture. For external relations, I developed and managed the network and relationships between the team and stakeholders, including users, authors, advisors, partners and publishers.
My secondary role was **Market Researcher**. For primary research, I gathered and processed data from Google Forms surveys using Microsoft Excel and Python to assess the potential of and determine the market audience for our product. For secondary research, I collected and analyzed market and industry reports from market research agencies as well as competitors.
